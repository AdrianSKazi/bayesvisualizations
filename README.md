# Visualizations for ISYE6420

Working on creating some little web apps with visualizations to support [ISYE6420](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/intro.html).

Webapps aren't working yet, but you can recreate the visualizations locally using the files in the scripts folder.

## Examples

###  /notebooks/RWMetropolis.ipynb or /scripts/RWMetropolis.py 

Random-walk Metropolis with a Gamma-Gamma conjugate model, see [Unit 5 Lesson 6](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/unit5/Unit5-Metropolis.html).

For the notebook, you can install [mercury](https://runmercury.com/docs/installation/) and run locally to get a bunch of little sliders to adjust parameters and reload the 
visualization. It's kind of cool. I'm also hosting them [here](https://isye6420.runmercury.com/), but I'm not sure how long the free plan will hold up. It also runs much faster 
locally.
