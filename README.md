# Visualizations for ISYE6420

Working on creating some little web apps with visualizations to support [ISYE6420](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/intro.html).

Webapps aren't working yet, but you can recreate the visualizations locally using the files in the scripts folder.

## Scripts

- RWMetropolis.py: Random-walk Metropolis with a Gamma-Gamma conjugate model, see [Unit 5 Lesson 6](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/unit5/Unit5-Metropolis.html).
